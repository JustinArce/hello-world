# hello-world
My first repository, learning how to use GitHub.

Hey!
I study Industrial Engineering, and realized I love coding at a basic programming course. I am trying to learn as much as possible, hope to be able to code for fun, build projects and eventually work as a freelancer. My main goals now are improving in python, and learning about data structures.
